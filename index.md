- E-7 Rapid Prototyping Proposal Analysis Excel Tool (*Due to the nature of this work, I cannot attach files or include specifics*)
  - Utilized **pivot tables**, **LOOKUPS**, **SUMIFS**, etc. to create summary tables and charts from extremely complex proposal pricing sheet.
  - Created metrics for tracking proposal evaluation status to inform leadership on progress towards entering negotiations.
- E-7 Life Cycle Cost Estimate (*Due to the nature of this work, I cannot attach files or include specifics*)
  - Conducted research on analogous systems, performed various **data collection** tasks to compile messy data spanning 20 years into a clean and consolidated Excel workbook, **normalized data** by quantity and year, and provided workbook to teammates in order to expedite future data collection tasks.
  - Derived multiple **learning curves** from historical data on an analogous aircraft.  Implemented learning curves in E-7 production cost model.
  - Performed **sensitivity analysis** on input variables in order to provide Program Management with opportunities for cost savings as well as risk areas that will drive cost if not controlled.
