# Credit Card and Amazon Order Data Exploration

**Project description:** I used to keep all my receipts and track my spending in an Excel file manually, but I decided it was time to embrace the digital era and make use of Chase and Amazon storing my data. I downloaded my Amazon Order History (which goes all the way back to when I opened my account in 2013) and I downloaded the last few years of my credit card transaction data.

**Business Goals (aka Personal Finance Goals):**
1. Build **budget goals** for different spending categories
2. Track **monthly spending** against budget goals
3. Identify ways to **reduce spending**


**Raw data** Although the data from Amazon was more granular because it has every item purchased, the purchases were not categorized making it difficult to summarize in a meaningful way.  The credit card data was the opposite.  Each observation was at the total transaction level, lacking insight into individual purchases, but each transaction was labeled using the following categories: *Shopping, Groceries, Food & Drink, Home, Bills & Utilities, Professional Services, Automotive, Personal, Health & Wellness, and Gas*
