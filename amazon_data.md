## Amazon Order Data Exploration

**Project description:** I downloaded my Amazon Order History as a CSV file and after performing some transformations in PowerQuery, I was able to create some interesting visuals.  My goal was to gain a better understanding of my Amazon spending habits in hopes of reducing spending.  I also wanted to categorize the orders using the same labels that my Chase credit card uses so that I can look at my spending as a whole picture.  Chase categorizes all Amazon purchases as "Shopping", but I buy a lot of groceries on Amazon so I want them categorized that way.  I manually labeled the data by looking at the item description, but I used this labeled data to train a Naive Bayes model so that I can run future order data through the model for automated labeling.
